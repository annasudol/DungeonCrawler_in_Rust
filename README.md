Flappy Dragon

Flappy Dragon is a simple, retro-style game written in Rust using the Bracket-lib game engine. In this game, players navigate a dragon through obstacles by flapping its wings to avoid crashing. This project is built with high standards for clarity and simplicity, taking advantage of Rustâ€™s strong type system and the clippy linter for optimized code quality.
